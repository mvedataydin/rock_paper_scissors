# rock_paper_scissors
This is my first javascript project from The Odin Project's [curriculum] https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors
This project is simple rock paper scissors game which can be played from developer console.
I will upgrade this game so it can be played on user gui.
